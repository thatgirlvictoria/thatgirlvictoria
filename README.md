- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatgirlvictoria
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, art, music, traveling and cats
- 🌱 I am a software engineer with an educational background in Graphic Design, Communications, and Public Relations.

I have been freelancing as a graphic designer and frontend developer for a few years, while working with a client I was inspired to build a better POS so learned JavaScript.

Loved it so much I started freelancing as a full stack developer building web applications for clients and agencies. 

For the past year, I have been honing my software engineering skills to create better software and user experiences.

- 💞️ I’m looking to work with a production team.
- 📫 How to reach me? DM twitter @thatgirlVikki.
